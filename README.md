# Q&A
## Where is my Xcode location?
Type this line on your terminal and you can see it.

`xcode-select -p`

You will see something like this:

/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

## Where should I put the developer disk images?

\`xcode-select -p\`/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport

## Which developer disk images should I put on that folder?

What ever you want

# Easiest way to setup (coming soon)

`make install_disk_images`

Enjoy!
